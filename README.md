# flask-html

Part A: Create a new github repo called 'flask-html': 

Please follow along with lecture slides wk3b for tutorial associated with this assignment. 

Inside of the repo, please create at least 2 pages that are manually styled using HTML and CSS (no bootstrap). Each of the pages at a minimum should contain: 
- static text (e.g., headers or paragraphs) 
- at least one image (e.g., png, jpeg, etc...) 
- a button (does not need to be functional)

## info

I had based my repo on my previous flask assignment lozo6/flask-part-1

I had added a home page where you can go to two webpages

The first webpage is a login webpage where you can see the logo (which is an anime movie named Hello World)

The second webpage, I kept the same as it already satified requirements

Each webpage can return back to the home page
